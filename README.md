# Dux4FamilyGeneNetwork

This folder includes the R codes and processed count datasets in support of the study of Whiddon's peer-reviewed paper, "Conservation and innovation in the DUX4-family gene network (RNA-seq)" (add a hyperlink later). The RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data can be found in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE87282 and GSE85461.

There are four part of codes supporting different sets of our DUX4 RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, each of which is a stardard R package including the related binary object of gene counts (SummarizedExperiments) and R scripts.
- mm10.HuMoDoxy: ChIP-seq
- hg38.MB135.HDUX4: RNA-seq
- mm10.C2C12.mDUX: RNA-seq
- mm10.C2C12.HDUX4: RNA-seq
