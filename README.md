# Dux4FamilyGeneNetwork

This folder includes the R codes and objects supporting the Whiddon's peer-reviewed paper, "Conservation and innovation in the DUX4-family gene network (RNA-seq)" (add a hyperlink later). The related raw seqeunce data can be found at  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87266. 

There are four part of codes supporting different sets of our DUX4 RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, each of which is a stardard R package including the related binary object of gene counts (SummarizedExperiments) and R scripts.
- mm10.HuMoDoxy: ChIP-seq
- hg38.MB135.HDUX4: RNA-seq
- mm10.C2C12.mDUX: RNA-seq
- mm10.C2C12.HDUX4: RNA-seq
